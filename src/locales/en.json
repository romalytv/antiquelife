    "subtitle": "Your reliable guide to the world of European and Ukrainian antiques",
    "intro_1": "<b>Welcome to Antique Life</b> — a project that stood at the origins of modern antique and vintage culture in Ukraine.",
    "intro_2": "We started this business almost 20 years ago, long before European antiques became a mass trend. That is why today Antique Life is not just a store, but a trusted name.",
    "h2_1": "How we find unique items",
    "p_1_1": "Our work begins where most never go. We massively and regularly visit French flea markets, vintage markets, and local estate sales all over France — from big cities to small provinces. This is exactly where we find real gems: beautiful things with history, unexpected masterpieces, and items that have not yet reached galleries or resellers.",
    "p_1_2": "Thanks to this, we are able to offer <b>better prices without losing quality and authenticity</b>.",
    "h2_2": "Auctions and estate sales",
    "p_2_1": "A separate area of our work is auctions. We attend all key auctions in the south of France and other regions of Europe, where we buy lots both on client demand and for our permanent stock. This gives us access to items that rarely appear in open sales.",
    "p_2_2": "We also cooperate with organizations dealing with property clearance from houses and apartments. Thanks to these partnerships, we often get first access to sales of private collections and family estates — even before the items hit the market. This is where the strongest finds are born.",
    "h2_3": "Ukrainian heritage and European antiques",
    "p_3_1": "Antique Life is more than just France. For many years we have been working and continue to work with <b>authentic antiques of the Austro-Hungarian era</b> preserved on the territory of Ukraine.",
    "p_3_2": "A special place in our activity is occupied by Ukrainian decorative and applied heritage, in particular the art of Hutsulshchyna, as well as modern Ukrainian art, which we consider an important part of living cultural continuity.",
    "h2_4": "What you will find in our collection:",
    "list_1": "<b>affordable vintage</b> and unique trinkets with character;",
    "list_2": "<b>antiques</b> of museum and collectible level;",
    "list_3": "<b>interior items</b> that create an atmosphere, not just decor.",
    "conclusion_1": "Every item in Antique Life is a story, an emotion, and a touch of time.",
    "conclusion_2": "We work not on the principle of 'selling', but on the principle of finding exactly what resonates. We consult, select, accompany, and deliver — honestly, professionally, and with respect to the client.",
    "conclusion_3": "<b>Antique Life</b> is a business with a soul, experience, and responsibility to culture.<br>We were among the first.<br>We know the market from the inside.<br>And we remain the ones who set the standard.",
